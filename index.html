     <h2>About Me</h2>

     <p>I was born in Toronto, Ontario and moved to Los Angeles, California with my family when I turned 9.
     <br>

     I am currently 23 years-old and have developed an addiction to traveling and exploring new cultures.
     <br>

     My boyfriend Chris (pictured above), is my absolute best friend. We do everything together.
    <br>

     My ethnic background is Middle Eastern, specifically Lebanese. I speak arabic, but can't read or write it.
    <br>
     
     I have a degree in Biology from UCLA and am currently studying for a career change. Hopefully into web development.
    <br>

     My original plan was to become a doctor and potentially save lives; however, after my internship, I changed my mind.
    <br>

    </p>

    <p>Currently, I run two business. A luxury hair care line, and a Life Insurance Agency.
    <br>

     Both of these jobs are very rewarding in different ways. I love helping people, and I get 
     <br>

     to do so with beauty and finances. These ventures are both very recent for me, but I love
     <br>

     both these opportunities endlessly. 
    <br>
